# adb-event-record
adb-event-record is a tool to record sensor's events like touch event and so on using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge).

During Android development you often want to record or reproduce some issues or testing steps. 

This script solves that problem by recording device's events like touch event, input event, and etc. Thus, you can use this script to play the recorded events back to do the repeated steps atuomatically. 

### Setup
 
* You need to enable USB debugging mode.

* Clone this project or download the python files
```
git clone https://github.com/tzutalin/adb-event-record.git

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzutalin/adb-event-record/master/adbrecord.py; chmod +x adbrecord.py
